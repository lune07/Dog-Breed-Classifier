Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed in my project


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: yes, each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Additionally, both VGG and AlexNet exhibit excellent performance in distinguishing between images of "dogs" and "not-a-dog," achieving a perfect accuracy rate of 100%. However, when it comes to identifying the specific breed of dog, VGG performs better than AlexNet, accurately classifying the breed in over 90% of cases. This high level of accuracy in dog breed classification makes VGG the preferred model architecture for precise and reliable identification of dog breeds in image classification tasks.
