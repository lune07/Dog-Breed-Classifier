# Dog-Breed-Classifier

1. **Project Scope:** Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify dog breeds and determine object similarity to dog breeds, offering both scratch-trained and pre-trained CNN models for this task.

2. **Udacity Collaboration:** Collaborative project proposed by Udacity, leveraging a guided Jupyter notebook that outlines the problem-solving process. The project covers data import, dog and object detection, CNN creation from scratch, and transfer learning for breed classification.

3. **Problem Statement:** The project's primary goal is to distinguish between images containing dogs and objects. By using a pre-trained model for dog detection, it provides accurate results by identifying dogs or humans that resemble specific dog breeds and includes error handling for cases with neither dogs nor humans in the image.
